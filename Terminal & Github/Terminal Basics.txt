Terminal Basics.

Part 1

1. mkdir first
2. cd first
3. touch person.txt
4. person.txt -> a
5. cp another.txt copy.txt
6. rm copy.txt
7. cp-r first second
8. rmdir second

Part 2

1. The man command is used to look at the manual and see what a specific command would do. It also shows which flags are associated with certian commands. To scroll out you can use the arrow keys and pressing q to quit the manual.

2. The -l flag gives you a long output for the ls command, which will allow you to see the file sizes with their lists.

6. Option + arrow keys.
7. Ctrl + E
8. Ctrl + A
9.Ctrl + W
10. The shell is an interpreter, which allows the user to understand the processed commands, while the terminal is the environment where you input text and get an output.

11. The absolute path is how to reach a file or folder from the root directory.

12. The relative path is relative to where you are currently at.
13.Flags can change and even enhance commands. I've used -r, -rf, -a
14. The r will remove folders and go through each folder while the f is force removal.
