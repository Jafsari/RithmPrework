Git Branching + Merging Exercise
Part 1

1. Git clean will remove files that aren't in the staging area.

2. The -d and -f flags remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files.

3. git checkout-b creates a branch.

4. The difference is that fast forwards can only happen if there haven't been any commits to the original branch.

5. git checkout changes to another branch.

6. git checkout will remove modified or deleted files.

7. git Branch -D will remove a branch.

8. The git diff command will show you a difference between two different commits.

9. TO remove files from the staging area you have to use git reset HEAD 

10. Merge conflicts happen when git can't determine what file or folder to choose when there are two different commits to the same file.
